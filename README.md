**About PedroAI**  
op-aitool is part of the PedroAI project
([trackmania-ai](https://github.com/trackmania-ai) on github), which I
began in April 2020. I streamed AI training on
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pedroaitm) from April 2021 to September
2023. Iâ€™ve since moved on to other projects and decided to open-source
PedroAI. For more details, check the
[blog](https://www.trackmania.ai/blog/).
